## Methodology
Scoring uses hedonic regression with OLS town dummies, tier models (budget/mid/premium),
and premium location multipliers (pool, prestige, frontline, Costa del Sol premium).

Five scoring dimensions: Value (40%), Yield (25%), Location (20%), Quality (10%), Risk (5%).

Yield estimates use real Airbnb/Booking.com comparable data with seasonal occupancy adjustments.
